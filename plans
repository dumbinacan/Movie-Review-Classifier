########IDEA OF IMPLEMENTATION##############################

preproc
 space out tokens and to lower case everything. function for file, then a function that calls it on all files in given directory.
NB
 the bit about the model
  given a vocab, features, and a file, count all the occurences of the features and insert them into the vocab
   make function that calls it on all files in a given directory.
  run function on neg and tots with with the neg reviews.
  run function on pos and tots with with the pos reviews. //worry about tots after everything else is up and running
 the bit about testing and predicting
  feature vector of size features.len()
   setting features as an index allows us to do something like featvec[featuers[feature]] to access a given feature
